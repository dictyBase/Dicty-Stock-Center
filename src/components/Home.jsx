        The DSC is a rapidly growing central repository for Dictyostelium discoideum strains,
        isolates of other cellular slime mold species, plasmids, commonly used food bacteria
        and other materials, such as antibodies. The DSC is located at Northwestern University
        in Chicago, IL, USA.

        The collection is being built by requesting published strains and plasmids.
        We encourage and also periodically remind investigators to send new mutants, natural
        isolates, and plasmids, once they have been published. Validation of the materials is
        mostly done by observable phenotypes, while mutants are also tested for drug-resistance
        markers. Plasmids will be checked by performing one or two diagnostic restriction enzyme
        digests, and are stored both as DNA and as transformed bacteria at -80Â°C. However, a large
        component of the quality control program will consist of feedback from the recipients of
        materials. Strains are stored at two different locations in liquid nitrogen, either as
        spores or as vegetative amoebae.
